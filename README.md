<h4>📌 Project Overview :</h4>

AI Model Inventory Manager is a modern full-stack web application built with React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Firebase Authentication. The platform allows users to add, edit, and delete their own AI models, explore and purchase models from others, all within a secure, private-route environment.

--Users must be logged in to access private routes such as Add Model, My Models, and Purchased Models.

--Any model added by a user is automatically stored in their My Models page.

--Users can view details of other models and purchase them, which then appear in their Purchased Models page.

--Only the creator of a model can update or delete it, ensuring data integrity and ownership.

--All sensitive actions are secured on both frontend and backend using Firebase Authentication and token verification.

The platform simulates real-world AI model repositories like Hugging Face, Kaggle, and Model Zoo, providing hands-on experience in managing, categorizing, and securing AI models. This project demonstrates full-stack integration, real-time UI updates, and robust security, making it an excellent example for developers learning practical AI model management and secure web application development.
