      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
        AI models are computational algorithms designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
        They can understand and generate text, recognize images, make predictions, and more. AI models are the backbone of modern intelligent applications.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold text-gray-600">
        Common examples include:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-lg text-gray-500 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Text Models:</strong> e.g., BERT, GPT for natural language understanding and generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Vision Models:</strong> e.g., YOLO, CLIP for image recognition and processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech Models:</strong> e.g., Whisper for speech recognition tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Generative Models:</strong> e.g., Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN for creating realistic images.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
        AI models power applications like chatbots, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, digital art, and healthcare diagnostics. 
        Efficiently managing these models is essential for research, deployment, and collaboration in AI projects.
